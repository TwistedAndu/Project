  <p><em>The Cheapest,yet the worst buisness in the game without the upgrades and even with the upgrades,Document forgery is a small buisness,the upgrades cost around 1 milion dollars if you wish to invest in this buisness but it is the worst in the game since selling a full ''product'' bar will result in 126k dollars just selling it in the city,and also has a mission where you would require more players to save yourself some time.So in terms of when to get it,make this buisness your last purchase or try to avoid it if possible</em></p>
